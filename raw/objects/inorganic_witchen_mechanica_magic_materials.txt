Some kind of oily liquid of the moon with a milky appearance, distinct from lunium
[INORGANIC:MILK_OF_LUNE] I found something called this on Google from some newspaper scans, but it was very little. This isn't meant to be that. (I couldn't see the scanned image properly but it might just say milk of lime.) There is also something called moonmilk-- this isn't that either.
